## What is TODO list?
The TODO lis format is based on GFM - GitHub Flavored Markdown - Task Lists.
TODO list is a file that contains tasks organized in multiple sections.
Tasks in TODO list can be visualized using Kanban Board where sections become columns on the board.
Inspired by Keep a Changelog
## Why keep a TODO.md?
For a project, there any many sources of information like Documentation, Issue forum, Wiki pages, etc. It is hard to find out about the current progress.

Keeping a TODO file makes it easier for anyone who wants to know about the project's plans and work that needs to be done.

## Why not using online management tools?
Often times, a new project starts with a list of tasks to outline what needs to be done quickly.

Although some online tools are useful to manage larger projects efficiently, using them in the early stages will add more effort and overhead for small projects.

A few other reasons like: portable plain text format, same project directory, offline working, privacy, versioning (using git), minimalist tool, etc.

## Adding a todo item
We’ve come this far without discussing the adding of todos. Let’s do that now. Beneath the list (or empty state if the list is empty) is a text input and “add” button:
## Deleting todo items
Checking off and deleting todo list items are distinct actions. Because sometimes you want to see which items you’ve done, and sometimes you add todo items to your list that you didn’t mean to, or which become non-applicable.
