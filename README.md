## Why keep a TODO.md?
For a project, there any many sources of information like Documentation, Issue forum, Wiki pages, etc. It is hard to find out about the current progress.

Keeping a TODO file makes it easier for anyone who wants to know about the project's plans and work that needs to be done.

## Why not using online management tools?
Often times, a new project starts with a list of tasks to outline what needs to be done quickly.

Although some online tools are useful to manage larger projects efficiently, using them in the early stages will add more effort and overhead for small projects.

A few other reasons like: portable plain text format, same project directory, offline working, privacy, versioning (using git), minimalist tool, etc.

## Introduction to all format files:-

#### HTML File:- An HTML file contains Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) that formats the structure of a webpage. It is stored in a standard text format and contains tags that define the page layout and content of the webpage, including the text, tables, images, and hyperlinks displayed on the webpage. HTML files are widely used online and displayed in web browsers.

#### CSS File:-CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.

#### JS File:-It separates HTML and code. It makes HTML and JavaScript easier to read and maintain. Cached JavaScript files can speed up page loads.
